# Task: Templatize Calculator Functions

Read TODO.md and work through the task list.

## Iteration Process

1. Read TODO.md at the start of each iteration
2. Pick the first unchecked `[ ]` task
3. Implement that task following C++ coding style from CLAUDE.md
4. Tests build automatically via PostToolUse hook after file edits
5. If test fail, fix the issue before moving on
6. If tests pass, mark task complete in TODO.md with `[x]`
7. Commit changes with descriptive message
8. Move to next unchecked task

## Current Status

At the start of each iteration:
- Check `git log --oneline -10` to see what previous iterations accomplished
- Review existing code before making changes
- Read TODO.md to find the next unchecked task

## Important Notes

- **Don't rely on conversation memory** - Always read TODO.md at the start
- Follow C++ coding style from CLAUDE.md strictly
- ensure it builds with all tests passing after each iteration
- Mark tasks complete only after verification
- **If tests fail, do NOT output COMPLETE** - Fix the issue and iterate until tests pass

## Completion

When ALL tasks in TODO.md are `[x]` and all tests pass, output:

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
